Abstract:

Few-shot learning is an eye-catching area in images classification. However, cor-
rectly classifying the images based on a few examples is not hard for humans but
extremely difficult for machines. In this project, based on the matching network,
we propose to replace the nearest neighbor classifier with label propagation. More
fine-tuning strategies will be shown in the report.
